      " b'This is a reunion, a team, and a great episode of Justice. From hesitation to resolution, Clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny, to a Superman who, like Green Arrow, sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones, ready to save the whole planet. This is not just a thrilling story about teamwork, loyalty, and friendship; this is also about deciding what\\'s more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the series to end, but I hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what Justice shows without any \"rewind\" pushes and put a good end here of Smallville---and a wonderful beginning of Superman.<br /><br />In this episode, however, we should have seen more contrast between Lex and the Team. Nine stars should give it enough credit.'\n",

      " b'\"Hey Babu Riba\" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed \"Esther\" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything American it seems.<br /><br />The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).<br /><br />I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational pace required it, but I couldn\\'t always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers\\' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.<br /><br />I would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).'\n",

It's a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios. Of course ANYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth watching. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz singing is a bonus. This lady is in the same league as the late Ella.

This is very important, as every dataset requires different standardization, depending on its contents. After the standardization, the layer tokenizes the text (splits into words) and vectorizes it (converts from words to numbers) so that it can be fed to the neural network. The `output_sequence_length` is set to 250, which means that the layer will pad shorter sequences or truncate longer sequences, so they will al have the same length.

And Leslie Caron can't really, um, you know... act.<br /><br />But somehow, 'An American In Paris' manages to come through it all as a polished, first-rate musical--largely on the basis of Gene Kelly's incredible dancing talent and choreography, and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with Caron. (He needs to, because she seems to have a... problem with emoting.) <br /><br />The most accomplished and technically awe-inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet towards the end of the film. It's stunningly filmed, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favourite number would have to be Kelly's character singing 'I Got Rhythm' with a bunch of French school-children, then breaking into an array of American dances. It just goes to prove how you don't need special effects when you've got some real *talent*.<br /><br />Not on the 'classics' level with 'Singin' In The Rain', but pretty high up there nonetheless.

    "You can see that after 25 epochs, the training accuracy still goes up, but the validation accuracy already plateaus at around 86%. On the other hand both training and validation losses are still decreasing, which means that while the model does not learn to predict more cases accurately, it still gets more confident in its predictions. Here you used the simplest possible model: you have used embeddings, averaging layer and a dense layer with one output. You can try different architectures to see if the model improves. Perhaps you can add some dropout layers to reduce the chance of overfitting, or you can try a completely different architecture, like using convolutional layers or reccurent layers. You will learn a lot more about recurrent neural networks in the later weeks of this course."

Previously, you applied the TextVectorization layer to the dataset before feeding it to the model. To simplify deploying the model, you can include the TextVectorization layer inside your model and then predict on raw strings. To do so, you can create a new sequential model where you merge the vectorization layer with your trained model using the weights you just trained."

If you have a general understanding of the code in this lab, you are very well suited to start working on this weeks programming assignment. There you will implement some of the things shown in this lab from scratch and then create and fit a similar model like you did in this notebook."
